create an “equation” question with question code “randnumber” and the following content at the question text field, which will generate a random number between 1 and 2:
{if(is_empty(randnumber.NAOK),rand(1,2),randnumber.NAOK)}

Set “Always hide this question” to “yes”

Use conditions at following questions to show version A or version B of a question.

Alternatively you can use the “relevance” field to define when a question should be shown. The appropriate relevance reads:
((randnumber.NAOK==”1″))

for the second question:
((randnumber.NAOK==”2″))

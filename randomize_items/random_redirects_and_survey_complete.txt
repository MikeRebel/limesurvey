Create a question of type equation with code randnumber and as question text you simply add:

{if(is_empty(randnumber.NAOK), rand(1,3), randnumber.NAOK)}

Create question of type equation using question code redirecturl and based on the random number you can define URLs for 3 different surveys.

{if(randnumber.NAOK == 1, "https://survey.mydomain.com/index.php/111111", 
if(randnumber.NAOK == 2, "https://survey.mydomain.com/index.php/222222", 
https://survey.mydomain.com/index.php/333333"))}

At the survey settings enable Automatically call end URL and at the End URL text field of the setting just add {redirecturl.NAOK}.
